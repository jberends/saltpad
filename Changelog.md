## [0.1](https://github.com/tinyclues/saltpad/tree/0.1) (2016-01-06)

Saltpad has been entirely rewritten as a single app page using React. This leads to several enhancements:

- Better responsiveness.
- More interactive.
- Helps solves the job launching UX.
- Easier to deploy.

This rewrite and architecture change now require that the salt-api is contactable from the browser directly. If it's a concern for you and don't want to use the new version because of it, please open an issue.
